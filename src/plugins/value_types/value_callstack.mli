  The Shared_callstack module provides more sharing for callstacks. It
  does so by plugging itself in some callstack producers. Currently,
  only the Value_util.call_stack hidden reference is updated.

  Ideally we would like the callstack type to be abstract and
  hash-consed. This change would impact a lot of places, so this
  module may be used to do a soft transition by updating only
  callstack producers to use this abstract type internally but provide
  the concrete callstack type. As long as callstack users do not touch
  these callstacks, they will remain shared and the memory footprint
  will be smaller.
